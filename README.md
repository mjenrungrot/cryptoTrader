Crypto Trader
=============

 

Summary
-------

*CryptoTrader* is a simple Rails application that allows users to trade Bitcoin
in simulation using the real-time prices. The prices of Bitcoin will be pulled
from other online sources via an external API. This application is able to track
prices in real time, and users are able to keep their own portfolio within our
application. Each registered user starts with a money of \$1,000,000. For the
sake of simplicity of this application and the timespan, we are only use the
prices of BTC vs USD.
