Crypto Trader
=============

 

Summary
-------

*CryptoTrader* is a simple Rails application that allows users to trade Bitcoin
in simulation using the real-time prices. The current price of Bitcoin will be taken
from Coindesk (https://www.coindesk.com/) via an external API. To use the application,
users need to signup using an ID and password. Once signed up, each user will have a 
money of $1,000,000 US Dollars. Users can trade their USD with Bitcoin and vice versa.
Each user's portfolio is then kept in the database.

--------------
